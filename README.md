# Simple robot to test Windows Desktop setups

Contains Robocorp Robot which only tests the Windows RDP connection functionality.

This robot is good candidate for monitoring your Self-hosted Windows Workers.
Setup this robot to run scheduled, with low priority and email or Slack notifications on the workers you want to monitor, and you have a really simple notification system that pings you if the workers go offline.
In cases where you do not have direct link to the IT (which we always recommend) this is a simple way to stay up-to-date. 

## Robot steps
  
  1. Open Windows Notepad
  2. Input test `Hello World!`
  3. Take Screenshot
  4. Teardown
